The Bill Tracker also lets user to view a history of each bill payment, so they can see how much amount for the bill payment has changed over time. 
Billing record - it helps you to track it allâ€”from your credit card to utilities, and even your offline payments.
Reports and findings - these are based on the analysis of billing data collected from the user, which can help the user to adjust and arrange the billings efficiently.
